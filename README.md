## First update
The idea of SAT/SMT is very new to me. I am picking up bits and pieces of the material during lecture regarding the negations, DeMorgan's, etc.. but am definitely struggling to understand the overarching idea from a high level. I first skimmed the paper and then read over it carefully another time and understood the big picture. Wikipedia helped a lot.

* An SAT solver, when given a boolean expression determines whether or not there exists a combination of values for each variable such that the expression is true.
* An SMT solver is an SAT solver in which variables are replaced by expressions which contain computations
